# Altair

#Not exactly — on GitHub, you can structure it to show both a short, resume-friendly version and a detailed, humanized version, but they go in different places. Here’s how:


---

1️⃣ Repository Name & Short Description

At the top of your GitHub repo, there’s a “Repository Description” (next to the repo name).

Keep this short and impactful, like a 1–2 line summary:


Altair: AI-powered OSINT & Knowledge Graph platform uncovering hidden insights from public data


---

2️⃣ README.md (Main Humanized Description)

This is the longer, humanized story.

Include:

Project overview / motivation

Features / bullet points

Screenshots / demo links (optional)

Tech stack

How to run / contribute



Example structure:

# Altair

Altair is an AI-powered intelligence analysis platform I built to uncover hidden insights from publicly available data. It collects and processes open-source datasets, extracts entities and relationships using NLP, and visualizes complex connections in an interactive knowledge graph. The platform generates actionable intelligence and research-ready reports, combining AI, graph analysis, and OSINT techniques to explore patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. 

## Features
- OSINT Data Collection & Structuring
- NLP Entity Extraction & Analysis
- Knowledge Graph Visualization (Neo4j)
- AI-driven Summaries, Link Prediction, Anomaly Detection
- Interactive Dashboard for Graphs, Maps, and Timelines

## Tech Stack
Python, Neo4j, NetworkX, Streamlit/React, spaCy, HuggingFace Transformers, GitHub Pages

✅ Tip

Short bio / description = shows in search results and on your profile → quick impression.

README.md = full, rich, humanized story → for anyone visiting your repo.


This way, you get the best of both worlds: fast clarity + research storytelling.

If you want, I can write a complete, ready-to-copy README.md for Altair that’s Harvard-level and includes both the short and long description perfectly.

Do you want me to do that?

> "Uncovering the unseen. Mapping the hidden. Turning data into intelligence."

Altair is an **AI-driven intelligence analysis platform** designed to reveal hidden connections and patterns in publicly available data. Inspired by advanced intelligence operations, it ingests open-source datasets, extracts entities and relationships with cutting-edge NLP, and maps them in a dynamic knowledge graph. The platform generates actionable intelligence, interactive visualizations, and research-ready insights — transforming raw data into clarity and foresight.

---

## Mission
To transform publicly available information into **strategic knowledge**, bridging **AI, graph analysis, and OSINT** to empower research, cybersecurity, and intelligence-driven decision-making.

---

## Features

- **OSINT Data Collection:** Aggregates structured and unstructured datasets from multiple public sources.
- **Entity Extraction & NLP:** Uses AI models (spaCy, HuggingFace Transformers) to identify entities, events, and hidden relationships.
- **Knowledge Graph Visualization:** Maps complex networks of entities in **Neo4j** for pattern discovery and link analysis.
- **AI-Driven Insights:** Generates summaries, predicts connections, highlights anomalies, and produces actionable intelligence reports.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Explore relationships through graphs, maps, and timelines, just like a high-tech intelligence control room.
- **Research-Focused Design:** Fully reproducible and extensible for academic research and cybersecurity applications.
